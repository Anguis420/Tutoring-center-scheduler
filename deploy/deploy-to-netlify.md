# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide

## ✅ Your App is Ready for Deployment!

Your Tutoring Center Scheduler has been successfully built and is ready for Netlify deployment.

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Go to Netlify Dashboard
1. Visit [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account

### Step 2: Create New Site
1. Click **"New site from Git"**
2. Choose **GitHub** as your Git provider
3. Select your repository: `Anguis420/Tutoring-center-scheduler`
4. Choose branch: `netlify-release`

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings
- **Build command**: `npm run netlify-build`
- **Publish directory**: `client/build`
- **Node version**: `18` (pinned via netlify.toml)

**Note**: Node.js version is pinned to 18 in the `netlify.toml` file. The project uses `netlify.toml` to specify the Node version rather than relying on automatic detection. See the configuration below:

```toml
[build.environment]
  # Set Node.js version
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

### Step 4: Deploy
1. Click **"Deploy site"**
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

## 🔧 Environment Variables Setup

**IMPORTANT**: After deployment, you MUST set environment variables:

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Add new variable:
   - **Key**: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - **Value**: Your backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.herokuapp.com/api`)

## 🌐 Backend Deployment Options

### Option 1: Heroku (Recommended)
```bash
# From your project root
heroku create your-app-name
heroku config:set MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-atlas-uri"
git push heroku main
```

### Option 2: Railway
1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy

### Option 3: Render
1. Go to [Render](https://render.com)
2. Create new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Set environment variables
5. Deploy

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

1. **Check the build logs** in Netlify dashboard
2. **Visit your site** at the provided Netlify URL
3. **Open browser console** (F12) to see debug logs
4. **Verify the API URL** is correct in console

## 🔍 Troubleshooting
