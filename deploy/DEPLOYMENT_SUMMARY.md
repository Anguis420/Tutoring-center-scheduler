Your Tutoring Center Scheduler is now optimized for Netlify deployment!

## ✅ What's Been Configured

### 1. Netlify Configuration Files
- **`netlify.toml`** - Main Netlify configuration
- **`client/public/_redirects`** - SPA routing support
- **Updated `.gitignore`** - Cleaned up deployment-specific exclusions

### 2. Build Scripts
- **`npm run netlify-build`** - Optimized build for Netlify
- **`npm run build:netlify`** - Client-side build command
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Static asset caching** - 1 year cache for JS/CSS files
- **Security headers** - XSS protection, content type validation
- **SPA routing** - All routes properly handled

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Your Changes
```bash

git commit -m "Configure for Netlify deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign in
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose GitHub and select your repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run netlify-build`
   - **Publish directory**: `client/build`
5. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
In Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Environment variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

## 🔧 Local Testing

## 🌐 Access Points

- **Frontend**: Your Netlify URL (e.g., `https://your-app.netlify.app`)
- **Backend**: Your separate backend deployment
- **Local Development**: `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) + `http://localhost:5000` (backend)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Verify all dependencies are committed
- Check Netlify build logs

### Routing Issues
- Ensure `_redirects` file is in `client/public/`
- Verify `netlify.toml` has correct redirects

### API Connection Issues
- Check `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable
- Ensure backend is accessible from Netlify
- Verify CORS settings on backend
- Ensure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable is set on backend with your Netlify domain
